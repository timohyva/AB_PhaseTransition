Repsositry of modules and codes devoted on A-B transtion, bubble nucleation and some confinements physics 

![WP2][QUEST_DMC_WP2]

## Descriptions
This repository provides modules and codes about many calculations based on strong coupling (SC) corrected Ginzburg-Landau model of Superfluid Helium-3. It is developed to implement different kinds of calculations involving SC-Ginzburg-Landau free energy and dydic tensor field/order parameter of symmetry-breking phases of Helium-3 in mK level temperature. The strong coupling correction data sheet comes from Physical Review B papers by Robert.C.Regan, J.J.Wiman and James. A. Sauls:
1. *"Vortex phase diagram of rotating superfluid  3He−B"*
    [Vortex phase diagram of rotating superfluid 3He−B](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.101.024517)
2. *"Superfluid phases of 3He in nanoscale channels"* 
    [Superfluid phases of 3He in nanoscale channels](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.92.144515)


The basic block of this repo consists of three modules:
<p align="center">
    Module-SCCO-V0*, Module-SC-Beta-V0*, Module-SCC-bB-V0*
</p>

[SCCO](https://github.com/timohyva/AB_PhaseTransition/blob/master/Module_SCCO_V02.py) offers an object, which directly talks with strong coupling data sheet and generates required SC corrected data. The calling requirments is set as coming from [SC-Beta](https://github.com/timohyva/AB_PhaseTransition/blob/master/Module_SC_Beta_V03.py). This module provides the interfaces, though which the pre-indices, the dimensionless munerical values of SC data and the characteristic dimensional qualities (e.g., Tc, N(0), Kb * Tc, V_{Fermi} and coherent length) can be independently called as object attributes. It allows most of interested qualities in Helium-3 can be called though the handy module [SCC-bB](https://github.com/timohyva/AB_PhaseTransition/blob/master/Module_SCC_bB_V00.py). For the detailed informations about how these features are implemented, please read the head comments of module files and How To Use)

## How To Use

### Python ![Python](https://github.com/timohyva/AB_PhaseTransition/blob/master/logo_languge11.png)
The defult way is launching from bash. And it's ok for runing in IDE.
```shell
# import SCC-bB module. 
~$ python3 import Module_SCC_bB_V0* as SCCB 
```
After importing, the phyical qualities can be invoked as object attributes:
* SCCB.alpha_bar(p, T)
* SCCB.beta1_bar(p, T)
* SCCB.beta2_bar(p, T)

...
or

* SCCB.betaA_bar(p, T)
* SCCB.betaB_bar(p, T)

and

* SCCB.DeltaA2_bar(p, T)
* SCCB.DeltaB2_bar(p, T)

##

Module fphi-AtoB-V0* is an example about using SCCB objects.
